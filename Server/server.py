"""

Struct is used to add packet length headers to the tcp packets that we are sending.
It helps us to identify packets seperately by reading a single packet without grabbing data from other packet
for example:

If you send two consecutive packets,
packet1 : Ahmed
packet2 : { time: "none", love: "none" }

if you send them fast enough they might end up like this

Ahmed{ time: "none", love: "none"}

therefore your json encode would raise WTF error.
